###Credentials
Admin : admin@admin.com : pass : admin
User One : user@one.com : pass : userone
User Two : user@two.com : pass : usertwo

I have created a simple task management system suitable for an orgranistion or group in which the admin can assign task to users which they have to complete and make then mark the task as completed, if needed they can add a response, if they are unable to complete or have too many tasks they can reject the task which the user can reassign to someone else.
I have stored the login and user credentials in cookies and JWT Token for Security.
Users and Admins have dashboard to show stats and search functionality ease finding a specific task.
For Tables i have used Material UI and Tailwind CSS for the rest.

2) Add Option To Allow a Task To be assigned to all users present in database or multiple users at once
3) Add More Filter and Other Options in Dashboard.

You Can any improvements you can think of
